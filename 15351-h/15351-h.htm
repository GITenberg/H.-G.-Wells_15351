<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>THE NORMALITY OF MR WELLS</h3>


<p>In his Preface to the <i>Unpleasant Plays</i>,
Mr Shaw boasts his possession of
&quot;normal sight.&quot; The adjective is the
oculist's, and the application of it is Mr
Shaw's, but while the phrase is misleading
until it is explained to suit a particular
purpose, it has a pleasing adaptability, and
I can find none better as a key to the works
of Mr H.G. Wells.</p>

<p>We need not bungle over the word
&quot;normal,&quot; in any attempt to meet the
academic objection that it implies conformity
to type. In this connection, the
gifted possessor of normal sight is differentiated
from his million neighbours by the
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>fact that he wears no glasses; and if a few
happy people still exist here and there who
have no need for the mere physical assistance,
the number of those whose mental
outlook is undistorted by tradition, prejudice
or some form of bias is so small that we
regard them as inspired or criminal according
to the inclination of our own beloved
predilection. And no spectacles will correct
the mental astigmatism of the multitude,
a fact that is often a cause of considerable
annoyance to the possessors of normal
sight. That defect of vision, whether congenital
or induced by the confinements of
early training, persists and increases throughout
life, like other forms of myopia. The
man who sees a ball as slightly flattened,
like a tangerine orange too tightly packed
(an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot; would be the
physicist's brief description), seeks the
society of other men who share his illusion;
and the company of them take arms against
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>the opposing faction, which is confirmed in
the belief that the ball is egg-shaped, that
the bulge, in fact, is not &quot;oblate&quot; but
&quot;prolate.&quot;</p>

<p>I will not elaborate the parable; it is
sufficient to indicate that in my reading of
Mr Wells, I have seen him as regarding all
life from a reasonable distance. By good
fortune he avoided the influences of his
early training, which was too ineffectual to
leave any permanent mark upon him. His
readers may infer, from certain descriptions
in <i>Kipps</i>, and <i>The History of Mr Polly</i>,
that Wells himself sincerely regrets the
inadequacies of that &quot;private school of
dingy aspect and still dingier pretensions,
where there were no object lessons, and the
studies of book-keeping and French were
pursued (but never effectually overtaken)
under the guidance of an elderly gentleman,
who wore a nondescript gown and took
snuff, wrote copperplate, explained nothing,
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>and used a cane with remarkable dexterity
and gusto.&quot; But, properly considered,
that inadequate elderly gentleman may be
regarded as our benefactor. If he had been
more apt in his methods, he might have influenced
the blessed normality of his pupil,
and bound upon him the spectacles of his
own order. Worse still, Mr Wells might
have been born into the leisured classes,
and sent to Eton and Christchurch, and if
his genius had found any expression after
that awful experience, he would probably,
at the best, have written polite essays or a
history of Napoleon, during the intervals
of his leisured activity as a member of the
Upper House.</p>

<p>Happily, Fate provided a scheme for preserving
his eyesight, and pitched him into
the care of Mr and Mrs Joseph Wells on the
21st September 1866; behind or above a
small general shop in Bromley. Mrs Wells
was the daughter of an innkeeper at Mid<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>hurst
and had been in service as a lady's
maid before her marriage. Joseph Wells
had had a more distinguished career. He
had been a great Kent bowler in the early
sixties, and it must have been, I think, only
the year before the subject of our essay
appeared at Bromley that his father took
four wickets with consecutive balls and
created a new record in the annals of cricket.
The late Sir Francis Galton might have made
something out of this ancestry; I must
confess that it is entirely beyond my powers,
although I make the reservation that we
know little of the abilities of H.G. Wells'
mother. She has not figured as a recognisable
portrait in any of his novels.</p>

<p>The Bromley shop, like most of its kind,
was a failure. Moderate success might
have meant a Grammar School for young
Wells, and the temptations of property, but
Fate gave our young radical another twist
by thrusting him temporarily within sight
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>of an alien and magnificent prosperity,
where as the son of the housekeeper at Up
Park, near Petersfield, he might recognise his
immense separation from the members of the
ruling class, as described in <i>Tono-Bungay</i>.</p>

<p>After that came &quot;the drapery,&quot; first at
Windsor and then at Southsea; but we
have no autobiography of this period, only
the details of the trade and its circumstances.
For neither Hoopdriver, nor Kipps, nor Polly
could have qualified for the post of assistant
at Midhurst Grammar School, a position
that H.G. Wells obtained at sixteen after
he had broken his indentures with the
Southsea draper.</p>

<p>At this point we come up with Mr Lewisham,
and may follow him in his experiences
after he obtained what was, in fact, a scholarship
at the Normal School of Science, South
Kensington; but we drop that hero again
before his premature marriage and failure,
to follow the uncharted course of Wells
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>obtaining his B.Sc. with first-class honours;
passing to an assistant-mastership at the
Henley House School, St John's Wood, and
so coming by way of tutor, lecturer and
demonstrator to the beginnings of journalism,
to the breaking of a blood-vessel and
thence, without further diversion, to the
trade of letters, somewhere in the summer
of 1893.</p>

<p>I have taken as my text the normality of
Mr Wells, on the understanding that I shall
define the essential term as I will; and this
brief outline of his early experiences may
help to show, <i>inter alia</i>, that he viewed life
from many angles before he was twenty-seven.
That he had the capacity so to see
life was either a lucky accident or due to
some untraceable composition of heredity.
That he kept his power was an effect of his
casual education. He was fortunate enough
to escape training in his observation of the
sphere.</p>

<p><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>Persistent repetition will finally influence
the young mind, however gifted, and if Mr
Wells had been subject to the discipline of
what may be called an efficient education, he
might have seen his sphere at the age of
twenty-seven as slightly flattened&mdash;whether
it appeared oblate or prolate is no consequence&mdash;and
I could not have crowned
him with the designation that heads this
Introduction.</p>

<p>He is, in fact, normal just in so far as his
gift of vision was undistorted by the precepts
and dogmas of his parents, teachers
and early companions.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II" /><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>II</h2>

<h2>THE ROMANCES</h2>


<p>Mr Wells' romances have little
or nothing in common with those
of Jules Verne, not even that
peculiar quality of romance which revels in
the impossible. The heroes of Jules Verne
were idealised creatures making use of some
wonderful invention for their own purposes;
and the future of mankind was of no account
in the balance against the lust for adventure
under new mechanical conditions. Also,
Jules Verne's imagination was at the same
time mathematical and Latin; and he was entirely
uninfluenced by the writings of Comte.</p>

<p>Mr Wells' experiments with the relatively
improbable have become increasingly involved
with the social problem, and it would
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>be possible to trace the growth of his opinions
from this evidence alone, even if we had
not the valuable commentary afforded by
his novels and his essays in sociology. But
his interest in the present and future welfare
of man would not in the first place have
prompted him to the writing of romance
(unless it had been cast in the severely allegorical
form of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>), and
if we are to account for that ebullition, we
shall be driven&mdash;like Darwin with his confounding
peacock&mdash;to take refuge in some
theory of exuberance. The later works
have been so defensive and, in one sense,
didactic that one is apt to forget that many
of the earlier books, and all the short stories,
must have originated in the effervescence of
creative imagination.</p>

<p>Mr Wells must, also, have been slightly
intoxicated by the first effects of reaction.
A passage from <i>The Future in America</i>
exhibits him somewhat gleefully reviving
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>thoughts of the prison-house, and I quote
it in order to account for his first exercises
in prophecy by a study of contrasts. &quot;I
remember,&quot; he writes, &quot;that to me in my
boyhood speculation about the Future was
a monstrous joke. Like most people of my
generation, I was launched into life with
millennial assumptions. This present sort of
thing, I believed, was going on for a time, interesting
personally, perhaps, but as a whole
inconsecutive, and then&mdash;it might be in my
lifetime or a little after it&mdash;there would
be trumpets and shoutings and celestial
phenomena, a battle of Armageddon, and the
Judgment.... To talk about the Man of the
year Million was, of course, in the face of this
great conviction, a whimsical play of fancy.
The year Million was just as impossible, just
as gaily nonsensical as fairyland....&quot;</p>

<p>The imprisoning bottle was opened when
he became a student of biology, under
Huxley, and the liquid of his suppressed
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>thought began to bubble. He prefaced his
romances by a sketch in the old <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i>, entitled <i>The Man of the Year
Million</i>, an a priori study that made one
thankful for one's prematurity. After that
physiological piece of logic, however, he
tried another essay in evolution, published
in 1895 in book form under the title of <i>The
Time Machine</i>&mdash;the first of his romances.</p>

<p>The machine itself is the vaguest of mechanical
assumptions; a thing of ivory,
quartz, nickel and brass that quite illogically
carries its rider into an existing past or
future. We accept the machine as a literary
device to give an air of probability to the
essential thing, the experience; and forget
the means in the effect. The criterion of the
prophecy in this case is influenced by the
theory of &quot;natural selection.&quot; Mr Wells'
vision of the &quot;Sunset of Mankind&quot; was of
men so nearly adapted to their environment
that the need for struggle, with its corol<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>lary
of the extermination of the unfit, had
practically ceased. Humanity had become
differentiated into two races, both recessive;
one, the Eloi, a race of childlike, simple,
delicate creatures living on the surface of
a kindly earth; the other, the Morlocks, a
more active but debased race, of bestial
habits, who lived underground and preyed
cannibalistically on the surface-dwellers
whom they helped to preserve, as a man
may preserve game. The Eloi, according
to the hypothesis of the Time Traveller,
are the descendants of the leisured classes;
the Morlocks of the workers. &quot;The Eloi,
like the Carlovingian kings, had decayed to
a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed
the earth on sufferance; since the
Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable
generations, had come at last to find the
day-lit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks
made their garments, I inferred, and
maintained them in their habitual needs
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>perhaps through the survival of an old
habit of service.&quot; All this is in the year
802,701 A.D.</p>

<p>The prophecy is less convincing than the
wonderful sight of the declining earth some
million years later, sinking slowly into the
dying fires of the worn-out sun. Man and
the vertebrates have disappeared, and the
highest wonder of animal life is represented
by giant crustaceans, which in turn give
way to a lower form. We have a vision of
an involution that shall succeed the highest
curve of development; of life ending where
it began in the depths of the sea, as the
initial energy of the solar system is dissipated
and the material of it returns to
rest at the temperature of the absolute zero.
And the picture is made more horrible to
the imaginative by the wonder whether
the summit of the evolutionary curve has
not already been reached&mdash;or it may be
passed in the days of the Greek philosophers.</p>

<p><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><i>The Time Machine</i>, despite certain obvious
faults of imagination and style, is a brilliant
fantasy; and it affords a valuable picture
of the young Wells looking at the world,
with his normal eyes, and finding it, more
particularly, incomplete. At the age of
twenty-seven or so, he has freed himself
very completely from the bonds of conventional
thought, and is prepared to examine,
and to present life from the detached
standpoint of one who views it all from
a respectable distance; but who is able,
nevertheless&mdash;an essential qualification&mdash;to
enter life with all the passion and generosity
of his own humanity.</p>

<p>And in <i>The Wonderful Visit</i>&mdash;published
in the same year as <i>The Time Machine</i>&mdash;he
comes closer to earth. That ardent ornithologist,
the Rev. K. Hilyer, Vicar of
Siddermouth, who brought down an angel
with a shot-gun, is tenderly imagined; a
man of gentle mind, for all the limitations
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>of his training. The mortalised angel, on
the other hand, is rather a tentative and
simple creature. He may represent, perhaps,
the rather blank mind of one who sees
country society without having had the
inestimable privilege of learning how it came
about. His temperament was something
too childlike&mdash;without the child's brutality&mdash;to
investigate the enormous complexities
of adjustment that had brought about the
conditions into which he was all too suddenly
plunged by a charge of duck-shot.
He came and was filled with an inalterable
perplexity, but some of his questions were
too ingenuous; and while we may sympathise
with the awful inertia of Hilyer
before the impossible task of explaining
the inexplicable differences between mortal
precept and mortal practice, we feel that
we might, in some cases at least, have
made a more determined effort. We might
have found some justification for chairs,
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>by way of instance, and certainly an excuse
for raising beds above the floor. But the
wounded angel, like the metal machine, is
only a device whereby the searching examination
of our author may be displayed
in an engrossing and intimate form. And
in <i>The Wonderful Visit</i>, that exuberance we
postulated, that absorption in the development
of idea, is more marked; in the unfolding
of the story we can trace the method
of the novelist.</p>

<p>Indeed, the three romances that follow
discover hardly a trace of the social investigator.
<i>The Island of Dr Moreau</i>, <i>The Invisible
Man</i> and <i>The War of the Worlds</i> are
essays in pure fantasy, and although the first
of the three is influenced by biology I class
it unhesitatingly among the works of sheer
exuberance. Each of these books is, in
effect, an answer to some rather whimsical
question, and the problem that Dr Moreau
attempted to solve was: &quot;Can we, by
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>surgery, so accelerate the evolutionary
process as to make man out of a beast in
a few days or weeks?&quot; And within limits
he found that the answer was: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>In the seclusion of his island, and with
the poor assistance of the outlawed medical
student, Montgomery, Dr Moreau succeeded
in producing some creditable parodies of
humanity by his operations on pigs, bulls,
dogs and other animals. These cut and
remoulded creatures had something the
appearance and intelligence of Homo
Sapiens, and could be maintained at that
level by the exercise of discipline and the
constant recital of &quot;the Law&quot;; left to
themselves they gradually reverted to the
habits and manners of the individual beasts
out of which they had been carved. We
may infer that some subtle organic chemistry
worked its determination upon their uncontrolled
wills, but Mr Wells offers no
explanation, psychic, chemical or biological,
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>and I do not think that he intended any
particular fable beyond the evident one
that, physically, one species is as like to
the next as makes no matter. What Moreau
did well another man might have done
better. It is a good story, and the adventures
of the marooned Prendick, alone,
are sufficient justification for the original
conception. (I feel bound to note, however,
the absurd comments of some early reviewers
who seemed to imagine that the story was
a defence of vivisection.)</p>

<p>The next romance (1897) seeks to answer
the question: &quot;What could a man do if
he were invisible?&quot; Various attempts to
answer that question had been made by
other writers, but none of them had come
to it with Mr Wells' practical grasp of the
real problem; the earlier romantics had not
grappled with the necessity for clothes and
the various ways in which a material man,
however indistinguishable his body by our
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>sense of sight, must leave traces of his passage.
The study from beginning to end
is finely realistic; and even the theory of
the albino, Griffin, and in a lesser degree
his method of winning the useless gift of
invisibility, are convincing enough to make
us wonder whether the thing is not scientifically
possible. As a pure romance set
in perfectly natural surroundings, <i>The Invisible
Man</i> is possibly the high-water mark
of Mr Wells' achievement in this kind.
He has perfected his technique, and the
interest in the development of the story
works up steadily to the splendid climax,
when the form of the berserker Griffin returns
to visibility, his hands clenched, his
eyes wide open, and on his face an expression
of &quot;anger and dismay,&quot; the elements&mdash;as
I choose to think&mdash;of man's revolt against
imprisonment in the flesh. It is worth
while to note that by another statement,
the same problem is posed and solved in
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>the short story called <i>The Country of the
Blind</i>.</p>

<p><i>The War of the Worlds</i> (1898), although
written in the first person, is in some ways
the most detached of all these fantasies;
and it is in this book that Mr Wells frankly
confesses his own occasional sense of separation.
&quot;At times,&quot; says the narrator of the
history, &quot;I suffer from the strangest sense
of detachment from myself and the world
about me, I seem to watch it all from the
outside, from somewhere inconceivably
remote, out of time, out of space, out of the
stress and tragedy of it all.&quot; That sense
must have remained with him as he wrote
the account of the invading Martians, so
little passion does the book contain. The
vision, however, is clear enough and there
is more invention than in many of the other
romances. The picture of the Martians
themselves develops in one direction the
theory of human evolution expressed in<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
<i>The Man of the Year Million</i>. The expansion
of the brain case, and the apotheosis
of pure intellect, devoid, so far as we can
judge, of any emotional expression, are the
steadily biological deductions that we should
expect from the Wells of this period. The
fighting machines of these incomprehensible
entities, the heat ray and the black smoke,
are all excellent conceptions; and the
narrative is splendidly graphic. But only
in the scenes with the curate, when the narrator
is stirred to passionate anger, and in
his later passages with the sapper, do we
catch any glimpses of the novelist intrigued
with the intimate affairs of humanity.
Even the narrator's brother, in his account
of the escape with two women in a pony-carriage,
has become infected with that
sense of detachment. The two women are
strongly differentiated but leave little
impression of personality.</p>

<p>The fact that I have made this comment
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>on lack of passion in describing one of these
earlier romances is indicative of a particular
difference between Mr Wells' method in this
sort and the method of the lesser writer of
fantasias. The latter, whatever his idea,
and it may be a brilliant idea, is always intent
on elaborating the wonder of his theme
by direct description. Mr Wells is far more
subtle and more effective. He takes an
average individual, identifies him with the
world as we know it, and then proceeds
gradually to bring his marvel within the
range of this individual's apprehension.
We see the improbable, not too definitely,
through the eyes of one who is prepared
with the same incredulity as the reader of
the story, and as a result the strange phenomenon,
whether fallen angel, invisible man,
converted beast or invading Martian, takes
all the shape of reality. That this shape is
convincing is due to the brilliance of Mr
Wells' imagination and his power of graphic
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>expression; the lesser writer might adopt
the method and fail utterly to attain the
effect; but it is this conception of the
means to reach the intelligence and senses
of the average reader that chiefly distinguishes
these romances from those of such
writers as Jules Verne. Our approach to
the wonderful is so gradual and so natural
that when we are finally confronted with it
the incredible thing has become inevitable
and expected. Finally, it has become so
identified with human surprise, anger or
dismay that any failure of humanity in the
chief person of the story reacts upon our
conception of the wonderful intrusion among
familiar phenomena.</p>

<p>Now, this power of creating the semblance
of fact out of an ideal was too valuable a
thing to be wasted on the making of stories
that had no purpose beyond that of interesting
or exciting the reader with such imaginations
as the Martians, whose only use was to
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>threaten humanity with extinction. Mr
Wells' own sight of our blindness, our complacent
acceptance of the sphere as an oblate
or prolate spheroid, might be, he hoped,
another of the marvels which we should
come to accept through the medium of
romance. So he began tentatively at first
to introduce a vivid criticism of the futility
of present-day society into his fantasies, and
the first and the least of these books was
that published in 1899 as <i>When the Sleeper
Wakes</i>, a title afterwards changed to <i>The
Sleeper Awakes</i>.</p>

<p>In the two opening chapters we find the
same delightfully realistic treatment of
the unprecedented slowly mingling with the
commonplace. The first appearance of
Graham the Sleeper, tormented then by the
spectres and doubts that accompany insomnia,
is made so credible that we accept
his symptoms without the least demur;
his condition is merely unusual enough to
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>excite a trembling interest. Even the passing
of his early years of trance does not
arouse scepticism. But then we fall with
one terrific plunge into the world of A.D.
2100, and, like Graham, we cannot realise it.
Moreover this changed, developed world has
a slightly mechanical air. The immense
enclosed London, imagined by Mr Wells, is
no Utopia, yet, like the dream of earlier
prophets, it is too logical to entice us into
any hallucination; and we come, fatally, to
a criticism of the syllogism.</p>

<p>Mr Wells himself has confessed, in a new
Preface, that this is &quot;one of the most ambitious
and least satisfactory&quot; of his books;
and explains that it was written against
time, when he was on the verge of a serious
illness. It is superfluous, therefore, to
criticise it in detail, but one or two points
in relation to the sociological idea must be
emphasised.</p>

<p>The main theme is the growing division
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>between Capital and Labour. The Giant
Trust&mdash;managing the funds accumulated in
Graham's name, a trust that has obtained
possession of so immense a capital that it
controls the chief activities of the world&mdash;is
figured in the command of a certain
Ostrog, who, with all the dependents that
profit by the use of his wealth and such
mercenaries as he can hold to himself, represents
one party in opposition to the actual
workers and producers, generically the
People. The picture is the struggle of our
own day in more acute form; the result,
in the amended edition, is left open. &quot;Who
will win&mdash;Ostrog or the People?&quot; Mr
Wells writes in the Preface referred to above,
and answers: &quot;A thousand years hence
that will still be just the open question we
leave to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not concerned in this place to question
the validity of that answer, nor to
suggest that the Wells of 1914 would not
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>necessarily give the same account of his
beliefs as the Wells of 1909, but I must draw
attention to the attitude displayed in the
book under consideration in order to point
the change of feeling recognisable in later
books. In <i>The Sleeper Awakes</i>, even in the
revised version, the sociological theory is
still mechanical, the prophecy at once too
logical, and at the same time deduced from
premises altogether too restricted. The
world of A.D. 2100 is the world of to-day,
with its more glaring contrasts still more
glaringly emphasised; with its social incongruities
and blindness raised to a higher
power. And all that it lacked has been put
into a romance called <i>In the Days of the
Comet</i> (1906), a book to which I shall now
leap, returning later to consider the comparatively
irrelevant theses of three other
romances that chronologically intervened.</p>

<p>The great change wrought by the coming
of the Comet might be sentimentally
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>described as a change of heart; I prefer to
call it a change of reason. All the earlier
part of the work, which is again told in the
first person, presents the life of a Midland industrial
area as seen by one who has suffered
it. The Capital-Labour problem bulks in
the foreground, and is adequately supported
by a passionate exposition of the narrowness
and misery of lower-middle-class life
in the jumble of limitations, barriers and
injustices that arise from the absolute ownership
of property. Also, into this romance&mdash;the
only one, by the way&mdash;comes some examination
of the relations of the sexes.
And all this jumble is due, if we are to
believe the remedy, to human misunderstanding.
The influence of the Comet
passed over the earth, and men, after a few
hours of trance, awoke to a new realisation.
We come to a first knowledge of the change
in one of the most beautiful passages that
Mr Wells has written; and although I
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>dislike to spoil a passage by setting it out
unclothed by the idea and expectations which
have led to its expression, given it form,
and fitted it to a just place in the whole
composition, I will make an exception in
this case in order to justify my metaphor
of &quot;normal sight.&quot; The supposed writer of
the description had just awakened from the
trance induced by the passing of the Comet.
He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;I came slowly, stepping very carefully
because of those drugged, feebly awakening
things, through the barley to the hedge. It
was a very glorious hedge, so that it held
my eyes. It flowed along and interlaced
like splendid music. It was rich with lupin,
honeysuckle, campions and ragged robin;
bed straw, hops and wild clematis twined
and hung among its branches, and all along
its ditch border the starry stitchwort lifted
its childish faces and chorused in lines and
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>masses. Never had I seen such a symphony
of note-like flowers and tendrils and
leaves. And suddenly, in its depths, I
heard a chirrup and the whir of startled
wings.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing was dead, but everything had
changed to beauty! And I stood for a
time with clean and happy eyes looking at
the intricate delicacy before me and marvelling
how richly God has made his
worlds....&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>And not only the writer but also every
other person on the earth had been miraculously
cured of their myopia and astigmatism.
They saw beauty and the means to still
more perfect beauty, and, seeing, they had
but to believe and the old miseries vanished.
In the old days men preached a furious
denial of self that led to the fatuity of an
asceticism such as that of St Simon Stylites.
The lesson&mdash;I cannot deny that the book is
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>didactic&mdash;of the change wrought by the
comet is that man should find the full expression
of his personality in sympathy and
understanding. The egotism remains, but
it works to a collective end....</p>

<p>War is necessarily touched upon in this
book as an inevitable corollary to the problems
of personal and a fortiori of national
property; but the real counterblast against
wholesale fratricide was reserved for the
following romance, published in 1908.</p>

<p><i>The War in the Air</i> definitely disclosed a
change of method that was adumbrated in
its predecessor. The agent of experience
is still retained in the person of Bert Smallways,
but the restrictions imposed by the
report of an eye-witness have become too
limiting, and, like Hardy in <i>The Dynasts</i>,
Mr Wells alternates between a near and a
distant vision. The Welt-Politik could not
be explained through the intelligence of a
&quot;little Cockney cad,&quot; even though he was<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>
&quot;by no means a stupid person and up to a
certain limit not badly educated&quot;; and the
general development of the world-war, the
account of the collapse of the credit system
and all such large and general effects
necessitated the broad treatment of the
historian. So the intimate, personal narrative
of Smallways' adventures is occasionally
dropped for a few pages; Mr Wells shuts
off his magic-lantern and fills the interval
with an analysis of larger issues.</p>

<p>And the issues are so vital, the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
so increasingly probable, that, despite
all the exaggerations necessary in a fiction
of this kind, the warning contained in this
account of a world-war is one that must
remain in the minds of any thoughtful reader.
Smallways' pert reflection on the causes of
the immense downfall represents the wisdom
that comes of bitter experience, and the
application of it is very pertinent to present
conditions. &quot;There was us in Europe all
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>at sixes and sevens with our silly flags and
our silly newspapers raggin' us up against
each other and keepin' us apart,&quot; says Smallways,
and for the briefest analysis of causes
that continually threaten us with all the
useless horrors of war, the summary could
scarcely be bettered.</p>

<p>Indeed, I think that <i>The War in the Air</i>
is the greatest of Mr Wells' achievements
in fantasy that has a deeper purpose than
mere amusement. The story is absorbing
and Smallways a perfectly conceived character,
recommendations that serve to popularise
the book as a romance; but all the
art of the construction is relevant to the
theme, and to the logical issue which is
faced unflinchingly. In the many wild
prophecies that have been incorporated in
various stories of a great European war,
there has been discoverable now and again
some hint of insight into the real dangers
that await mankind. But such stories as
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>these degenerate into some accidental, but
inferentially glorious, victory of British
arms, and any value in the earlier comments
is swamped in the sentimentality of the
fortuitous, and designedly popular, sequel.
In the book now under consideration the
conception is too wide for any such lapses
into the maudlin. British interests play an
insignificant part in the drama. We have
to consider war not as an incident in the
history of a nation, but as a horrible disgrace
in the history of humanity.</p>

<p>And war is the theme also of <i>The World
Set Free</i> (1914), but it leads here to a theory
of reconstruction of which we have no sight
in the earlier work. The opening chapters
describe the inception of the means, the
discovery of the new source of energy&mdash;a
perfectly reasonable conception&mdash;that led
to the invention of the &quot;atomic bomb,&quot; a
thing so terribly powerful and continuous in
its action that after the first free use of it in
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>a European outbreak, war became impossible.
As a romance, the book fails. The
interest is not centred in a single character,
and we are given somewhat disconnected
glimpses of various phases in the discovery
of the new energy, in its application, and of
the catastrophes that follow its use as an
instrument of destruction. The essay form
has almost dominated the method of the
novelist, and consequently the essential
parable has not the same force as in <i>The
War in the Air</i>. Nevertheless, the vision
is there, obscured by reason of its more
personal expression; and before I return
to consider the three less pertinent romances
interposed between those that have a more
recognisable critical tendency, I wish to sum
up the distinctive attitude of the four just
considered.</p>

<p>And in this thing I claim that the conscious
purpose of the artist is of comparatively
small account. I may be doing Mr<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>
Wells an injustice, either by robbing him of
the credit of a clearly conceived intention, or
by reading into his books a deliberation which
he might wish to disclaim. But my business
is not justice to the author in this sense, but
an interpretation&mdash;necessarily personal&mdash;of
the message his books have conveyed to a
particular reader. And the plain message
that all these romances&mdash;including those
that follow&mdash;have conveyed to me is the
necessity for ridding the mind of traditions
of the hypnotic suggestions of parents and
early teachers, of the parochial influences
of immediate surroundings, of the prejudices
and self-interested dogmatisms and hyperboles
of common literature, especially of the
daily and weekly press; in order that we
may, if only for an exercise in simple reason,
dissociate ourselves for a moment from all
those intimate forces, and regard life with
the calmness of one detached from personal
interests and desires. No human being who
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>has not thus stood apart from life can claim
to have realised himself; and in so far as
he is unable thus to separate himself temporarily
from his circumstances he confesses
that he is less a personality than a bundle
of reactions to familiar stimuli. But given
that power of detachment, the reader may
find in these four books matter for the reconsideration
of the whole social problem.
Whether he accept such tentative reconstructions
as those suggested in <i>The World
Set Free</i> or <i>In the Days of the Comet</i> is relatively
unimportant, the essential thing is
that he should view life with momentarily
undistracted eyes; and see both the failures
of our civilisation and its potentialities for a
finer and more gracious existence....</p>

<p><i>The First Men in the Moon</i> (1901) is little
more than a piece of sheer exuberance. The
theory of the means to the adventure and
the experience itself are both plausible.
There are a few minor discrepancies, but
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>when the chief assumption is granted the
deductions will all stand examination. The
invention of cavorite, the substance that is
impervious to the force&mdash;whatever it may
be&mdash;of gravitation, as other substances are
impervious to light, heat, sound or electricity,
is not a priori impossible, nor is the
theory that the moon is hollow, that the
&quot;Selenites&quot; live below the surface, or that
evolution has produced on our satellite an
intelligent form which, anatomically, is more
nearly allied to the insect than to the vertebrate
type as we know it. The exposition
of lunar social conditions cannot be taken
very seriously. Specialisation is the key-note;
the production by education and
training, of minds, and, as far as possible,
bodies, adapted to a particular end, and
incapable of performing other technical
functions. The picture of this highly developed
state, however, is not such as would
tempt us to emulation. As a machine it
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>works; as an ideal it lacks any presentation
of the thing we call beauty. The apotheosis
of intelligence in the concrete example leaves
us unambitious in that direction.</p>

<p>One chapter, however, stands apart and
elaborates once more that detachment for
space and time which I have so particularly
emphasised as the more important feature
of these particular books. Mr Bedford,
alone in his Cavorite sphere between the
Earth and the Moon, experiences this sensation
of aloofness. &quot;I became, if I may go
express it, dissociate from Bedford,&quot; he
writes. &quot;I looked down on Bedford as a
trivial, incidental thing with which I chanced
to be connected,&quot; Bedford, unfortunately
for my moral, was a poor creature who got
no benefit from his privilege, who flouted it
indeed and regretted his inability &quot;to
recover the full-bodied self-satisfaction of his
early days.&quot; Possibly the fact that in his
case the knowledge was thrust upon him
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>may account for his failure. It is only the
knowledge we seek that has any influence
upon us.</p>

<p><i>The Sea Lady</i> (1902) stands alone among
Mr Wells' romances. The realistic method
remains, but the conception is touched with
a poetic fancy of a kind that I have not found
elsewhere in these books. The Venus Annodomini
who came out of the sea at Folkestone
in the form of an authentic mermaid was
something more than a mere critic of our
civilised conventions. She was that, too;
she asked why people walked on the Leas
&quot;with little to talk about and nothing to
look at, and bound not to do all sorts of
natural things, and bound to do all sorts of
preposterous things.&quot; But she was also
the personification of &quot;other dreams.&quot; She
had &quot;the quality of the open sky, of deep
tangled places, of the flight of birds ... of
the high sea.&quot; She represented to one man,
at least, &quot;the Great Outside.&quot; And, if we
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>still find a repetition of the old statement
in that last description, it is, nevertheless,
surrounded with a glamour that is not revealed
in such books as <i>In the Days of the
Comet</i>. The ideal that is faintly shadowed
in <i>The Sea Lady</i> is more ethereal, less practical;
the story, despite the naturalistic,
half-cynical manner of its recountal, has the
elements of romance. The closing scene
describes the perplexity of a practical
Kentish policeman &quot;who in the small hours
before dawn came upon the wrap the Sea
Lady had been wearing, just as the tide overtook
it,&quot; He stands there on the foreshore
with a foolish bewilderment, wondering
chiefly &quot;what people are up to.&quot; He is
the &quot;simple citizen of a plain and obvious
world.&quot; And Mr Wells concludes: &quot;I
picture the interrogation of his lantern going
out for a little way, a stain of faint pink
curiosity upon the mysterious vast serenity
of the night.&quot; And I make an application
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>of the parable for my own purposes, and
wonder how far the curiosity of Mr Wells'
readers will carry them into the great mystery
that lies behind the illusion of this
apparently obvious world.</p>

<p>We come, finally, without any suggestion
of climax, to <i>The Food of the Gods</i> (1904).
The food was produced, casually in the first
instance, by two experimenters who served
no cause but that of their own inquisitive
science. One of them, Redwood, had become
intrigued by the fact that the growth
of all living things proceeded with bursts
and intermissions; it was as if they had &quot;to
accumulate force to grow, grew with vigour
only for a time, and then had to wait for a
space before they could go on growing
again.&quot; And Bensington, the other experimenter,
succeeded in separating a food that
produced regular instead of intermittent
growth. It was universal in its effects,
influencing vegetable as well as animal life;
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>and in the course of twenty years it produced
human giants, forty feet high. This
is a theme for Mr Wells to revel in, and he
does, treating the detail of the first two-thirds
of the book with a fine realism. Like
Bensington, he saw, &quot;behind the grotesque
shapes and accidents of the present, the
coming world of giants and all the mighty
things the future has in store&mdash;vague and
splendid, like some glittering palace seen
suddenly in the passing of a sunbeam far
away.&quot; The parable is plain enough, but
the application of it weakens when we
realise that so far as the merely physical
development goes, the food of the gods is
only bringing about a change of scale. If
we grant that this &quot;insurgent bigness&quot;
must conquer the world, the final result
is only humanity in the same relation to life
that it now occupies, and we are left to
reflect with Bensington, after the vision had
faded, on &quot;sinister shadows, vast declivities
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>and darknesses, inhospitable immensities,
cold, wild and terrible things.&quot;</p>

<p>The change of scale, however, so long as it
was changing, presents in another metaphor
the old contrasts. The young giants, the
Cossars and Redwood, looking down on
common humanity from a vantage-point
some thirty to forty feet higher than the
&quot;little people,&quot; are critical by force of
circumstances; and they are at the same
time handicapped by an inability to comprehend
the thing criticised. They are too
differentiated; and for the purpose of the
fable none of them is gifted with the power
to study these insects with the sympathy
of a Henri Fabre. We may find some
quality of blundering stupidity in the Cossars
and in young Redwood, they were too
prejudiced by their physical scale; but the
simple Caddles, born of peasant parents,
uneducated and set to work in a chalk
quarry, is the true enquirer. He walked up
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>to London to solve his problem, and his
fundamental question: &quot;What's it all
<i>for</i>?&quot; remained unanswered. The &quot;little
people&quot; could not exchange ideas with him,
and he never met his brother giants. It is,
however, exceedingly doubtful whether they
could have offered him any satisfactory
explanation of the purpose of the universe.
Their only ambition seemed to be reconstruction
on a larger scale.</p>

<p>I think the partial failure of <i>The Food of the
Gods</i> to furnish any ethical satisfaction is
due to the fact that in this romance Mr Wells
has identified himself too closely with the
giants; a fault that indicates a slight
departure from normality. The inevitable
contrast between great and little lacks a
sympathy and appreciation we find elsewhere.
&quot;Endless conflict. Endless misunderstanding.
All life is that. Great
and little cannot understand one another&quot;
is the true text of the book; and it implies
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>a weakness in the great not less than in the
little; a weakness that is hardly exonerated
by the closing sentence: &quot;But in
every child born of man lurks some seed of
greatness&mdash;waiting for the food.&quot; I find a
quality of reasonableness in the little people's
antagonism to the blundering superiority
of those giants.</p>

<p>To the tail of these romances I may pin
the majority of Mr Wells' short stories.
The best of them are all included in the
collection published under the title of <i>The
Country of the Blind</i>. In this form Mr
Wells displays nothing but the exuberance
of his invention. In the Preface to the
collection he defines his conception of short-story
writing as &quot;the jolly art of making
something very bright and moving; it may
be horrible or pathetic or funny, or beautiful,
or profoundly illuminating, having only this
essential, that it should take from fifteen
to twenty minutes to read aloud.&quot; I can
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>add nothing to that description, and would
only take away from it so much as is implied
by the statement that I cannot call to mind
any one of these stories which is &quot;profoundly
illuminating&quot; in the same sense
that I would certainly apply the phrase to
some of the romances. Jolly and bright
they undoubtedly are, but when they are
moving, they provide food for wonder rather
than for enlightenment....</p>

<p>I cannot leave these romances without
a comment on Mr Wells' justification as
preacher and prophet. Writing in the
midst of the turmoil of war, I am vividly
conscious of having had my mind prepared
for it by the material I have here so inadequately
described. All the misunderstandings,
the weaknesses, the noisy, meaningless
ambitions, the tepid acceptance of
traditional standards, have been exposed
by Mr Wells in these fantasies of his. And
in <i>The War in the Air</i>, with just such
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>exaggerations as are necessary for a fiction
of this kind, he has forecast the conditions
which have now overtaken us. We know&mdash;or
we might know if we had the capacity
for any sort of consequent consideration of
our conditions&mdash;that in a reasonably conducted
civilisation no such awful catastrophe
as this senseless conflagration could
have been possible. No doubt we shall
profit by the lesson, but it is one that any
individual might have learned for himself
from these romances, without paying the
fearful price that is now necessary. And
because humanity is apt to forget its most
drastic punishments, to revert to its original
inertia as soon as the smart is healed, I feel
that when the worst is over, these books will
have a greater value than ever before. I
believe that in them may be found just
those essentials of detachment and broad
vision which might serve to promote a
higher and more stable civilisation.</p>

<h2>III</h2>

<h2>THE NOVELS</h2>


<p>I am willing to maintain that H.G.
Wells is second to none as a writer of
romances of the type I have just examined.
I am less certain of his position
as a novelist. He brings to his fiction the
open-eyed recognition of realities, the fine
analysis of modern conditions, the lucid
consequent thought and the clean, graphic
style that mark the qualities of his other
method; he has that &quot;poetic gift, the gift
of the creative and illuminating phrase,&quot;
which, he has said, &quot;alone justifies writing&quot;;
but he has not the power of creating characters
that stand for some essential type of
humanity. On the one hand he is inclined
to idealise the engineer and the scientific
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>researcher, on the other to satirise and, in
effect, to group into one sloppy-thinking mass
every other kind of Englishman, not excepting
philosophers, politicians and social
reformers. This broad generalisation omits
any consideration of the merely uneducated,
such as Hoopdriver or Kipps, and the many
women he has drawn. But the former,
however sympathetically treated, are certainly
not idealised; and among the latter,
the only real creation, in my opinion,
is Susan Ponderevo in <i>Tono-Bungay</i>; although
there is a possible composite of
various women in the later books that may
represent the general insurgent character of
recent young womanhood. But now that
I have made this too definite statement I
want to go back over it, touch it up and
smooth it out. For if I have found Mr
Wells' character types too few and too
specialised; and as if, with regard to his
more or less idealised males&mdash;such as Capes,<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>
George Ponderevo, Remington, Trafford,
Stafford&mdash;he had modelled and re-modelled
them in the effort to build up one finally
estimable figure of masculine ability;
there still remains an enormous gallery of
subsidiary portraits, for the most part
faintly caricatured, of men and women who
do stand for something in modern life;
portraits that are valuable, interesting and
memorable. Nevertheless, I submit that
Mr Wells' novels will not live by reason of
their characterisation.</p>

<p>The desire to write essays in this class
of fiction does not seem to have overcome
Wells until the last few years. Before 1909,
he had written all his sociology and all his
romances, with the exception of <i>The World
Set Free</i>, but only three novels&mdash;namely,
<i>The Wheels of Chance</i>, <i>Love and Mr Lewisham</i>
and <i>Kipps</i>; and none of them gives any indication
of the characteristic method of the
later work.</p>

<p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>The first of the three, published in 1896,
is in one respect a splendid answer to the
objection against what has been called the
episodical novel. The story deals only with
ten glorious days in the life of Hoopdriver,
a callow assistant in a draper's &quot;emporium&quot;
at Putney. He learnt to ride a bicycle, set
out to tour the south coast for his short
summer holiday and rode into romance.
One section of the book is a trifle too hilarious,
coming perilously near to farce, but
underlying the steady humour of it all is
a perfectly consistent, even saddening,
criticism of the Hoopdriver type. He has
imagination without ability; life is made
bearable for him chiefly by the means of
his poor little dreams and poses; he sees
himself momentarily in the part of a detective,
a journalist, a South African millionaire,
any assumption to disguise the horrible
reality of the draper's assistant; and yet
there is fine stuff in him. (Perhaps the
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>suggested antithesis is hardly justified!)
We leave him at the door of the Putney shop
full of resolution to read, to undertake his
own education, in some way, no doubt, to
better himself, as he might have phrased it.
But we doubt the quality of his determination
and of the lasting influence of the
&quot;more wonderful desires and ambitions replacing
those discrepant dreams.&quot; We have
only followed Hoopdriver through a ten-day
episode, but all his story has been told.</p>

<p>We are in quite a different position with
regard to Lewisham. The history of his
encounter with love and the world, published
in 1900, covers a period of four or five years,
but while we leave him down-at-heel, with
a wife and a mother-in-law dependent upon
him, and the prospect of fatherhood adding
to his responsibilities, we are uncertain
whither his career will take him. Lewisham
is the first sketch for the type that was to
be elaborated in five subsequent books. The
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>allurements of his love for Ethel Henderson
spoilt his chances at the science school, but
he has the quality that is so conspicuously
lacking in the Hoopdriver-Kipps-Polly succession.
Lewisham had some resolution, undoubted
energy, and the beginnings of that
larger vision which was the gift of the later
protagonists. But he is not idealised; he
comes nearer to the average of humanity
than the later pictures of his like; although
they share with him that tendency to sudden
irascibility, to outbursts of a somewhat
petty temper against the obvious limitations
of life&mdash;a common tendency observable in
nearly all Mr Wells' dominant male characters.
Those few years of Lewisham's
life were so well done, so consistently developed,
that I have regretted the absence of
a sequel. Indeed, I still regret it, although
I realise very well that Mr Wells' steady
progress in the conception of his own purpose
as a writer has absolutely precluded
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>any return to an older method. Lewisham
was not quite strong enough to portray the
further development of the dominant idea,
not a sufficiently tempered tool for the dissection
of the modern world.</p>

<p>I have said little about the story of this
fragment of Lewisham's career; I have not
even mentioned that deliciously plausible
and able rogue, Chaffery, the fraudulent
medium; but in this essay I am more concerned
to trace the meaning of Mr Wells'
books than to criticise or praise the detail.
With regard to the latter, the reader may
always feel so perfectly safe. He need have
no doubt that description of action, of mood,
or of place will be vivid and convincing, true
to life and essential to the story. I do not
pass this detail by because I have found it
better done in other contemporary writers;
I have not; but because I find a pregnancy
and a growing force behind these minuti&aelig;
that is strangely lacking from any other
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>works of fiction in which I can find any comparison.</p>

<p>There are, however, still two more novels
to be disposed of before I can examine the
full expression of Mr Wells' purpose as I
find it in his later books. One of these
novels, <i>Kipps</i> (1905), is the next in chronological
order; the other, <i>The History of
Mr Polly</i>, was published in 1910, interpolated
between <i>Ann Veronica</i> and <i>The New
Machiavelli</i>. Both Kipps and Polly began
active life in a draper's shop. The former
is explicitly labelled &quot;a simple soul.&quot; He
is at once sillier and sharper than Hoopdriver,
but, like that &quot;dear fool&quot; (the phrase
is Mr Wells'), Kipps has some very sterling
qualities. He had the good fortune to come
into money&mdash;I cannot but count it good
fortune in his case&mdash;and was just wise enough
to avoid a marriage with Helen Walshingham&mdash;&quot;County
family. Related to the Earl of
Beaupr&eacute;s&quot;&mdash;and if he shirked that match
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>rather from sheer funk than from any clear
realisation of the futility of what he was
avoiding, he did, at least, run away with and
marry that very charming little housemaid,
Ann Pornick, whom he had loved in his
early boyhood. After his marriage he lost
the greater part of his money, and later recovered
it again; but all these shocks of
fortune left him the same simple soul, untroubled
by any urgent problems outside the
range of his personal experience. His brief
contact with the dreamer, Masterman, and
his friendship with the capable young
engineer-socialist, Sid Pornick, Ann's brother,
only roused Kipps to a momentary wonder,
and his final enunciation of the great question
was representative. &quot;I was thinking just
what a Rum Go everything is,&quot; he says.
That question, to quote Mr Wells, &quot;never
reached the surface of his mind, it never
took to itself substance or form; it looked
up merely as the phantom of a face might
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>look, out of deep waters, and sank again
into nothingness.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Polly is a third variant of the Hoopdriver-Kipps
genus. He had more initiative,
although he still presents a problem in inertia,
and he is the only one of the three who
had a feeling for literature, and read persistently,
if vagariously. And Mr Polly
did at last take his fate into his own hands,
commit arson, desert his wife and wander
off, an &quot;exploratious adventurer,&quot; as he
might have put it, to discover some joy and
poetry in life after a heroic battle that he
funked most horribly and might have
avoided. This may sound rather a criminal
record, and even so I have taken no account
of his fraud on the Life Assurance Company,
but no one could ever condemn Mr Polly&mdash;or
wish him a happier employment than that
he finally achieved partly by luck and partly
by his own effort. He was the sport of the
forces that break out so ungovernably in
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>this haphazard world. As the &quot;high-browed
gentleman living at Highbury&quot; explains:
&quot;Nothing can better demonstrate the collective
dullness of our community, the crying
need for a strenuous, intellectual renewal,
than the consideration of that vast mass
of useless, uncomfortable, under-educated,
under-trained, and altogether pitiable people
we contemplate when we use that inaccurate
and misleading term, the Lower Middle
Class. A great proportion of the lower
middle class should properly be assigned to
the unemployed and the unemployable.&quot;
And that is the moral we may lay to heart
from the presentation of these three quite
lovable and quite futile draper's assistants.
Their stories are told without didacticism;
the method displays at its brightest Mr
Wells' intimate knowledge and understanding
of the life and speech of the class portrayed;
the developments are natural and
absorbing enough to hold the interest of the
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>most idle reader; and here and there, perhaps,
an intelligent man or woman may be
stirred to realise that he or she is in part
responsible for the futility of a Hoopdriver
or a Kipps, or for the jovial crimes of Mr
Polly....</p>

<p>I come now to the six novels which represent
most truly the striving, persistent
idealism of the mature Wells. In these
books he has come to the mastery of his
own technique&mdash;so far as a man may ever
master it. He admits that there remain
inexpressible visions, he is apt at times to be
overtaken by his own mannerisms (a fault
that in no way affects the enjoyment or
enlightenment of the average reader), but
he has wrought and perfected a delicate instrument
of style that is finely adapted to
his purpose. I cannot avoid speaking of
&quot;purpose&quot; in relation to these five books,
and yet the word is misleading. I do not
mean by it that Mr Wells has ever sat down
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>to write a novel with the deliberate intention
of converting an honest reader or so. But
I do mean that he has tried very deliberately
to express his own attitude in these
books, and that whether or not he was
intentionally a propagandist, he has done
his utmost to explain and to glorify that
attitude of his. Perhaps I shrink from that
word &quot;purpose&quot; too sensitively, because
it is so naturally associated in the mind
with all that is clumsy and didactic in
fiction. The &quot;novel with a purpose,&quot; as
the dreadful phrase has it, is a horrible
thing, and none of this five could be so misdescribed.
Nevertheless it is very plain
that Mr Wells has deliberately selected his
stories and his characters to illustrate
certain points of view. The characters are
consistent, and the story growing out of
their influences and reactions is never
distorted in order to score a point for the
maintainer of a theory. But the prelimin<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>ary
selection cannot be overlooked. It has,
without question, been made in each case
to illustrate a thesis.</p>

<p><i>Ann Veronica</i> (1909) opens an aspect of
the sex question that has been amplified
in later novels. The chief person in the
story illustrates for us the revolt of young
women against the limitations of a certain,
the most representative, type of home discipline.
Ann Veronica was a well-educated
young woman with that leaning towards
biological science which seems an almost
necessary element in the make-up of Mr
Wells' exemplars of the open mind. She
came to an open quarrel with her father on
the question of attending a somewhat
Bohemian fancy-dress ball, and she had
the courage and determination to uphold
her declaration of independence. She ran
away, came up to London from her father's
suburb, took lodgings and essayed quite
unsuccessfully to make her own living. She
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>failed in this endeavour because she had not
been educated or trained for any of those
few and specialised occupations that women
may attempt in modern conditions. She
learned by experience various essentials
that had been omitted from any teaching
she had received at home, and ended that
phase of her life by falling in love with Capes,
demonstrator at the Westminster Imperial
College, a man who was living apart from
his wife. Ann Veronica's story is the first
serious essay in feminism&mdash;a term that takes
a much wider meaning in Mr Wells' definition
than is commonly attributed to it.
The novel presents the claim of the woman
to free herself from the restrictions that
once almost necessarily limited her sphere
of action, restrictions that are ever becoming
more meaningless in a civilisation that
has enforced new economic conditions.
But Mr Wells goes far beyond that elementary
proposition. He has tried in <i>Ann<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>
Veronica</i>&mdash;and again with a more delicate
probe in <i>Marriage</i> and <i>The Passionate
Friends</i>&mdash;to touch the hidden thing that is
causing all this surface inflammation. He
has analysed and diagnosed the exposed
evil, always it seems with a certain tentativeness,
and we are left to carry on his line of
research; many of the difficulties of the
problem are indicated, but no sovereign
specific for the malady.</p>

<p><i>Tono-Bungay</i> (1909) touches only casually
on the sex question. The involved love
affairs of George Ponderevo are less essential
than the career of his uncle, the inventor
of the patent medicine that gives a title to
the book. In many ways <i>Tono-Bungay</i> is
the best novel that Mr Wells has given us.
It is written in the first person, a narrative
form that afterwards served to convey Mr
Wells' interpolated criticisms of the bodies
social and politic in something nearly approaching
the shape of an essay, but in<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>
<i>Tono-Bungay</i> there are no important divagations
from the development of the story.
The framework of the book is provided by
the life history of the narrator from early
boyhood to middle age, matter interesting
enough in itself even if it had not provided
the means for revealing the inwardness of
Edward Ponderevo's character and career.
He was not a bad little man, this plump little
chemist; a Lombroso or a Ferri would have
found difficulty in classifying him as a
&quot;criminal type,&quot; however eager those investigators
might have been to confirm
their pet theories. Ponderevo's wife&mdash;the
inimitable Aunt Susan&mdash;called him &quot;Teddy&quot;
and his nephew endorses the appropriateness
of that diminutive; he affirms that
there was a characteristic &quot;teddiness&quot;
about Uncle Ponderevo. He failed as a
retail chemist in Wimblehurst. He was not
naturally dishonest, but he had windy ideas
about finance, and he was careless in the
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>matter of certain trust monies. He was
&quot;imaginative, erratic, inconsistent, recklessly
inexact,&quot; and his imagination led
him by way of a patent medicine to company
promoting on the Hooley scale. &quot;Do
you realise the madness of the world that
sanctions such a thing?&quot; asks Mr Wells
in the person of the supposed narrator and
points that question on a later page as
follows:&mdash;&quot;At the climax of his Boom, my
uncle at the most sparing estimate must
have possessed in substance and credit about
two million pounds' worth of property to
set off against his vague colossal liabilities,
and from first to last he must have had a
controlling influence in the direction of
nearly thirty millions. This irrational
muddle of a community in which we live
gave him that, paid him at that rate for
sitting in a room and scheming and telling
it lies. For he created nothing, he invented
nothing, he economised nothing. I cannot
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>claim that a single one of the great businesses
we organised added any real value to human
life at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The enormous success and rapid failure
of this futile, ambitious little chemist&mdash;a
success that is, unhappily, only too conceivable
and probable&mdash;are seen against the
background of his nephew's life, Mr Wells
has given a greater value and credulity to
the legal criminalities of Ponderevo, by
coming at him, as it were, through a wider
angle; just as he achieves all the circumstances
of reality in his romances by his
postulation of an average eye-witness. But
there are many threads in George Ponderevo's
life that were not immediately
intertwined with the <i>Tono-Bungay</i> career,
and his love for Beatrice Normanby touches
in quite another manner on the sex problem
opened in <i>Ann Veronica</i>. In both these
books the story is the essential thing, and
the attack upon social conditions is relatively
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>indirect. The general criticism is at times
quite explicit, but it is subordinated.</p>

<p>In <i>The New Machiavelli</i> (1910) these
relations are nearly reversed. The detailed
exposure of the moving forces that stimulate
our political energies, occupies long
sections into which the human relations of
Remington (the form is again that of an
autobiography) hardly enter, except in an
occasional conversation to sharpen up a
criticism. This comment on politics (regarded
in his own constituency, Remington
says, not as a &quot;great constructive process&quot;
but as a &quot;kind of dog-fight&quot;) is the chief
theme; subsidiary to it is the comment on
a society that could waste so valuable a
life as Remington's for the sake of a moral
convention. Both comments point Mr
Wells' expression of what he calls in this
book &quot;the essential antagonism ... in all
human affairs ... between ideas and the
established method&mdash;that is to say, between
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>ideas and the rule of thumb.&quot; And he adds:
&quot;The world I hate is the rule-of-thumb
world; the thing I and my kind exist for
primarily is battle with that, to annoy it,
disarrange it, reconstruct it.&quot; This confession
is so lucid and characteristic that I
cannot improve upon it, and yet I see that
it is a statement likely to arouse considerable
resentment, &quot;Of course we are detestable,&quot;
Remington admits in this connection;
and in these later, more urgently
critical novels, we recognise a little too
clearly that note of protest, almost of defensive
proclamation. And in none of them
do we see it more definitely than in the book
now under consideration. In many ways
<i>The New Machiavelli</i> stands apart from
the other novels. I find it a little bitter
in places, because the thing condemned
appears too small for such unequivocal
condemnation. The following superlative
summary is put into the mouth of a minor
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>character, but I think it is fairly representative
of Remington's later attitude. &quot;But
of all the damned things that ever were
damned,&quot; says the plain-spoken Britten,
&quot;your damned shirking, temperate, sham-efficient,
self-satisfied, respectable, make-believe,
Fabian-spirited Young Liberal is
the utterly damnedest.&quot; As a commentary,
I find this exaggerated; and although it is
in the mouth of one who is not presented
as a spokesman for Mr Wells' own opinions,
I feel that it comes very near to being a text
for a considerable section of the political
criticism; and that it indicates bias, a
departure from normality.</p>

<p>And yet, despite this occasional exhibition
of temper, <i>The New Machiavelli</i> is a most
illuminating book. It reveals with extraordinary
clearness the Wells of that period;
but it also gives us a sight of the spirit in
him that does not change. All his books,
romances, novels and essays indicate a
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>gradual process of growth; if we were to
apply any label to him, we should inevitably
land ourselves in confusion. He is
nothing &quot;in the first place&quot; but a man with
an intense desire to understand life. As he
says in this book: &quot;A human being who is
a philosopher in the first place, a teacher in
the first place, or a statesman in the first
place, is thereby and inevitably&mdash;though he
bring God-like gifts to the pretence&mdash;a
quack.&quot; But while he may dissociate himself
from any clique, and disclaim any fixed
opinion that might earn for him the offensive
and fiercely rejected label, he nevertheless
presents to us one unchanging attitude in
these very refusals. &quot;I'm going to get
experience for humanity out of all my
talents&mdash;and bury nothing,&quot; says Remington;
and that purpose is implicit in every
book that Wells has written. He is an
empiric, using first this test and then that
to try the phenomena of life; publishing the
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>detail of his experiment and noting certain
deductions. But while he may offer a prescription
for certain symptoms, he gives us
to understand that he is only diagnosing a
phase in human development; that he is
seeking an ultimate which he never hopes
to find, and that the deductions he draws
to-day may be rejected to-morrow without
a shadow of regret. He would be constant,
I think, only in his inconstancy to any
criterion of present conditions as applicable
or likely to be applicable to the future; he
sees life as a dynamic thing in process of
change and growth. &quot;All the history of
mankind,&quot; he writes, &quot;all the history of life
has been and will be the story of something
struggling out of the indiscriminated abyss,
struggling to exist and prevail over and comprehend
individual lives&mdash;an effect of insidious
attraction, an idea of invincible
appeal.&quot; And it is for this reason that he is
so eager to battle with, annoy, disarrange
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>and reconstruct that rule-of-thumb world
he censures so steadily; he is fighting the
assumption of a static condition which he
knows to be impossible.</p>

<p>And for a moment in <i>The New Machiavelli</i>,
and again in his next book, <i>Marriage</i>, he has
a passing vision of some greater movement
of which we are but the imperfect instruments.
He develops and then drops the
idea of a &quot;hinterland,&quot; not only to the individual
mind but to the general consciousness.
The &quot;permanent reality,&quot; he calls
it, &quot;which is never really immediate, which
draws continually upon human experience
and influences human action more and more,
but which is itself never the actual player
upon the stage. It is the unseen dramatist
who never takes a call.&quot; And in another
place he writes in the same connection:
&quot; ... the ideas go on&mdash;as though we are
all no more than little cells and corpuscles in
some great brain beyond our understanding.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>We come again to a hint of that explanation
at the end of <i>Marriage</i>, published in
1912. The story, reduced to the barest
outline, is that of the relations of Trafford
to his wife. It is not complicated by any
sexual temptations or jealousies, but it
gradually evolves the integral problem of
the meaning of life.</p>

<p>Trafford, before his engagement to
Marjorie Pope, and for a year or two after
his marriage, was engaged in research work.
His speciality was molecular physics and he
was a particularly brilliant investigator.
That research, with all the possibilities that
it held of some immense discovery of the
laws that govern the constitution of inorganic
and progressively, perhaps, of
organic, matter, was sufficient to engross his
mental energies, to give him a sense of satisfaction
in life; but his six hundred pounds
a year proved insufficient to satisfy the
demands of Marjorie's claim to enjoyment.<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>
She was not a mere type of the worldly-minded
woman. She represents, indeed, the
claim of modern women for a distinctive
interest and employment not less urgent and
necessary than the interests and employments
of men. And when she failed, as she
plainly must have failed, to find any such
occupation, her sense of beauty and her
justifiable demand for life found an outlet
largely in shopping, in entertaining, in all
such ephemeral attractions and amusements
as women in her class may seek and reject.
That way of escape, however, soon raised
financial obstructions to Trafford's work.
He had to find a means for increasing his
income, and came at last and inevitably to
the necessity for making more money and
continually still more. The road to wealth
was opened for him and he took it by sacrificing
his research work, but when the
economic problem had been triumphantly
solved, he could not return to his first
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>absorption in the problems of molecular
physics. Life pressed upon him at every
moment of the day, he had been inveigled
into a net.</p>

<p>The manner of Trafford's escape from the
thing that intrigued him has been severely
criticised. After I had first read the book
I too was inclined to deprecate the device
of taking Trafford and Marjorie into the
loneliness of a Labrador winter, in order to
set them right with themselves and give them
a clearer vision of life. But I have read
<i>Marriage</i> twice since I formed that premature
judgment, and each time I have
found a growing justification for what at
first may seem a somewhat whimsical solution
to the difficulties of an essentially social
problem.</p>

<p>But in effect this is the same specific that
I upheld in my comment on the romances; it
illustrates the need felt by a certain class of
mind for temporary withdrawal from all
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>the immediate urgencies and calls of social
life; the overwhelming desire to see the
movements and intricacies of human initiative
and reactions, from a momentarily
detached standpoint. And Mr Wells has
offered us a further commentary on the
difficulties of this abstraction, by withholding
any vision from Trafford until he
was finally isolated from Marjorie, and even
from any physical contact with the movement
of what we call reality, by illness and
fever. Only then, indeed, did he touch the
vital issues. I find the statement of this
ultimate thing, vaguely phrased in Trafford's
semi-delirium, presenting another expression
of the thought quoted from <i>The New Machiavelli</i>;
the conception of humanity as an
instrument. &quot;Something trying to exist,&quot;
he says, something &quot;which isn't substance,
doesn't belong to space or time, something
stifled and enclosed, struggling to get
through.&quot; And later he repeats: &quot;It
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>struggles to exist, becomes conscious, becomes
now conscious of itself. That is
where I come in as a part of it. Above the
beast in me is that&mdash;the desire to know
better, to know&mdash;beautifully, and to transmit
my knowledge. That's all there is in
life for me beyond food and shelter and
tidying up. This Being&mdash;opening its eyes,
listening, trying to comprehend. Every
good thing in man is that&mdash;looking and
making pictures, listening and making songs....
We began with bone-scratching. We're
still&mdash;near it. I'm just a part of this beginning&mdash;mixed
with other things. Every
book, every art, every religion is that, the
attempt to understand and express&mdash;mixed
with other things.&quot;</p>

<p>I have reached something like a climax
with this passage; a climax that I would
willingly maintain if it were possible, inasmuch
as it holds a representation of that
unchanging influence which I find as an in<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>spiration
and a force behind all H.G. Wells'
books. Necessarily this vital inspiration is,
as he says, &quot;mixed with other things&quot;; he
has had to find a means to express it, and
our means of expression is limited not only
by our own powers but in a large degree by
the limitations of the audience addressed.
Moreover H.G. Wells' art represents him in
that it is a practical art. He is, in an unspecialised
sense, a pragmatist. He comes
back from his isolations to find in this world
all the substance and potentialities of beauty
both in outward appearance and in conduct.
And he is not content to vapour of ideals.
He recognises that the stuff of admiration
and desire that animates his own being is
present throughout humanity. Only the
sight of it is obscured by all those stupidities
and condescensions to rule-of-thumb that
he attacks so furiously. Those are the impediments
that he would clear away, and
he acknowledges that they stand between
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>him and his own sight of beauty. He is
compelled always to struggle&mdash;and we can
see the signs of it in all he writes&mdash;with his
own weakness and limitations; criticising
himself as he satirises the thing condemned,
but striving without ceasing to
serve the purpose of that which he knows
is &quot;struggling to exist.&quot; This, to me,
is the spirit of H.G. Wells, and I find
it a spirit that is as admirable as it is
human....</p>

<p><i>The Passionate Friends</i> (1913) is another
experiment in exposition. The very real
and fine love of Stafford (the autobiographer
in this case) and Lady Mary Christian is
spoiled, made to appear insignificant and
debased, by all the conventions and petty,
unoriginal judgments that go to the making
of the rule of our society. The woman had
to make her choice between love in an undignified
poverty for which all her training
had unfitted her, and a sterile ease and
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>magnificence that gave her those opportunities
which her temperament and education
demanded. She chose for dignity and
opportunity, was tempted to grasp at love,
and thus finally came into a blind alley from
which death was the only escape. It is
another picture of the old conflict illustrated
in the persons of Ann Veronica and
Marjorie Trafford; the constant inability
that our conditions impose on the desire
to love beautifully. The implicit demand
is that for greater freedom for women,
socially and economically. Incidentally we
see that the man, Stafford, does not suffer
in the same degree. His splendid love for
Lady Mary is thwarted, but he finds an outlet.
It is a new aspect of escape, by the way,
for Stafford's illuminating business of spreading
and collating knowledge is a relief from
the scientific research which was in some
form or another the specific of the earlier
novels&mdash;if we exclude Remington's political
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>propaganda in <i>The New Machiavelli</i>, a suggested
solution that was, at the best, something
half-hearted. And Stafford's escape,
and his version of going to the mountain
apart&mdash;by way of a sight of the East and of
America&mdash;bring us back to that integral
theme which I have so insisted upon, even
at the risk of tedious repetition. &quot;I was
already beginning to see the great problem
of mankind,&quot; writes Stafford, &quot;as indeed
nothing other than a magnification of the
little problem of myself, as a problem in
escape from grooves, from preoccupations
and suspicions, precautions and ancient
angers.... For all of us, as for each of us,
salvation is that. We have to get away
from ourselves to a greater thing, to a giant's
desire and an unending life, ours and yet
not our own.&quot;</p>

<p>The last novel published at the time I
write is <i>The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman</i> (1914).
The same theme is presented, but in other
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>circumstances. Ellen Sawbridge, when she
married, at eighteen, the founder and proprietor
of &quot;The International Bread Shops,&quot;
was an ingenuous schoolgirl; and for more
than seven years the change from a relatively
independent poverty to the luxuries she
could enjoy as the wife of a man who had
not outgrown the Eastern theory with regard
to the position of women, sufficed to keep
her reasonably content. Mr Brumley was
the instrument of Fate that seriously disturbed
her satisfaction; but she must have
come to much the same crisis, if Mr Brumley
had never existed. Brumley was a writer,
but he was not one of &quot;the really imaginative
people, the people with vision, the
people who let themselves go&quot;&mdash;I quote the
expression of George Wilkins, the novelist&mdash;and
Lady Harman never fell very deeply in
love with him. Nevertheless it was through
Brumley's interference with her life that she
faced the crux of her position as the closely
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>restricted occupant of &quot;a harem of one.&quot;
She never broke out of that cage. One
desperate effort led her, by way of a
suffragist demonstration on a post office
window, to a month's freedom in prison;
but Sir Isaac and society were too clever
and too strong for her. When she was
enlarged from the solitude of confinement
in a cell, she was tricked and bullied into
the resumption of her marital engagements.
And presumably she must have continued
to act as the nurse of her now invalid husband
for the rest of her life, suffering the indignities
of his abuse and the restrictions of
liberty that the paid attendant may escape
by a change of situation, if release had not
come through Sir Isaac's death. By that
time Lady Harman had learnt her lesson.
I am distinctly sorry for Mr Brumley, but
I should have been seriously disappointed
in Ellen Harman if she had consented to
marry him.</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>Thus far I have only traced an imperfect
outline of what I take to be the more important
motive of the book. But there is
a second pattern hardly less essential&mdash;namely,
the criticism of the management
and, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, of the conception of principle,
in relation to the International Bread
Shops. Arising out of this interwoven
theme we come to some examination of the
status of the female employee in general,
and particularly in connection with the
question of their board and lodging outside
business hours. But in <i>The Wife of Sir
Isaac Harman</i> the essay manner has been
abandoned. Any diversion from the development
of the story is carried out by
the expressed opinions of the characters
themselves; and, as a consequence, the two
essential problems are not unduly intruded
upon the reader, although for that very
reason they may remain longer in his
thoughts. One more comment should be
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>added, which is that this is the wittiest book
that Mr Wells has yet given us. However
serious the motives that give it life, it must
be classed as a comedy....</p>

<p>In concluding this brief review of Mr
Wells' novels, I feel that I must hark back
to a passage in <i>The Passionate Friends</i> in
order to indicate a spirit which, if it is not
so definitely phrased in this last book of his,
is certainly upheld in the matter of the
story. For it is that spirit which seems to
me the thing that should live and be remembered.
Here is one of its more characteristic
expressions in the mouth of
Stafford, who writes:</p>

<p>&quot;I know that a growing multitude of
men and women outwear the ancient ways.
The bloodstained organised jealousies of
religious intolerance, the delusions of
nationality and cult and race, that black
hatred which simple people, and young
people and common people cherish against
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>all that is not in the likeness of themselves
cease to be the undisputed ruling forces of
our collective life. We want to emancipate
our lives from this slavery and these stupidities,
from dull hatreds and suspicions.... A
spirit ... arises and increases in human
affairs, a spirit that demands freedom and
gracious living as our inheritance too long
deferred....&quot;</p>

<p>And surely H.G. Wells has striven to give
a freer and more vital expression to that
spirit, working through his own life, than
any other novelist of our day. Indeed I
would go further and claim that no such
single and definite inspiration can be found
in the works of any other secular writer.
Wells has given to the novel a new criticism
and, to a certain degree, a new form.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h2>SOCIOLOGY</h2>


<p>Mr Wells' essays in sociology are
not dry treatises, based on Blue
books and the gathering together
of information and statistics from a formless
and largely worthless collection of
earlier sources. He has approached this
question of man in relation to the State in
the same generous spirit displayed in his
works of fiction; and it is only by using
the word &quot;sociology&quot; in its fuller sense as
conceived by Comte, rather than in the
restricted sense of &quot;social science&quot; with its
implication of economics, as narrowed by
Herbert Spencer, that I dare to head this
last chapter with so dangerously technicalised
a term. Indeed, I would not use the
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>word &quot;sociology&quot; now if I could find a
more inclusive heading. For it must be
obvious, I think, to anyone who has followed
my exposition of the romances and the
novels that Mr Wells has a way of treating
all such subjects as relate to the betterment
of humanity with a broad outlook, an entire
disrespect for conventional forms however
hallowed by precedent, and a habit of
trenchant criticism that could hardly be
fettered by an analysis of sociological literature
or continual deference to this or
that experiment in practice or theory. He
approaches his subject with the normal
mind of one who sees the world, its customs
and rules of conduct, from what is, after all,
the point of view of common-sense&mdash;another
term that has been so grossly misused that
the possessor of true common-sense is apt to
be regarded as a most uncommon person. It
is, in fact, the least common of qualities.</p>

<p>The first three books under this heading
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>form some sort of a trilogy, and have a
definite air of consequence. Of these,
<i>Anticipations</i> was published in 1901, and
<i>Mankind in the Making</i> and <i>A Modern
Utopia</i> followed in 1903 and 1905 respectively.
The scheme of the first two books
combines a criticism of present conditions
with a growing constructiveness that points
the way to the ideal of what is called &quot;The
New Republic.&quot; Now, one of the labels that
has been most frequently and adhesively
affixed to Mr Wells is that of &quot;Socialist,&quot;
and no doubt it would proclaim his purpose
admirably enough if we could satisfactorily
define the word in its relation to him. But,
personally, I refuse so to label him, because
I know that socialism means as many things
to different people as religion, and is as much
a term of reproach in the mouth of some self-labelled
individualists as the designation
&quot;Christian&quot; might be in the mouth of the
&quot;true believers&quot;&mdash;as the Mohammedans
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>call themselves. Wherefore I am particularly
anxious in approaching any description
of &quot;The New Republic,&quot; to make
it quite clear that that idealised State is
not built of the bricks that have been
modelled and cast by any recognisable group
of propagandists, working to permeate, or
more forcibly to convert, a section of the
public under the flags of, say, Fabianism
or Social Democracy. The essential thing
about Mr Wells is that he is not a Follower,
whether of Marx, or Hyndman, or Shaw,
or Bebel; he may have learnt from any or
all of them, but his theory of social reconstruction
is pre-eminently and characteristically
his own. He does not believe in
the private ownership of land, for example,
but I do not remember that he has ever
advocated the means of the &quot;Single Tax.&quot;
And in these sociological essays, as in his
novels, his method is that of picturing
the more desirable thing or condition, the
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>method of sweet persuasion rather than that
of the sectarian who has a pet specific.
Nevertheless Mr Wells uses his sharpened
weapon of satire with considerable effect
when he contemplates and displays for us
the world as he sees it to-day. I find no
hint of sweetness or persuasiveness on that
side.</p>

<p>It would be impossible in an exposition
of this kind to dissect these essays in detail,
nor would it be desirable. Many of the
suggestions with regard to actual practice,
suggestions that might be embodied in
modern legislation, are open to criticism in
detail, and I would not pin Mr Wells down
to the letter of any one of them. He has
certainly changed his mind on many points
since he wrote these essays in constructive
sociology, and the fact that he has so altered
and enlarged his opinions is the best possible
evidence of his reliability and sincerity.
He is before all else devoted to the services
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>of growth and progress. &quot;To rebel against
instinct,&quot; he writes, &quot;to rebel against limitation,
to evade, to trip up, and at last to close
with and grapple and conquer the forces that
dominate him, is the fundamental being of
man.&quot; And no man can hope to dominate
those forces, if he is content to let his opinions
crystallise at the age of thirty-five or so.
If he would retain his powers of criticism
and construction he must have the patience
and the energy to maintain the normal, receptive
mind with which he is naturally
endowed. Unfortunately with that endowment
commonly comes another&mdash;namely,
a tendency to avoid the irk or constant
struggle by taking the line of least resistance;
by adopting an opinion and upholding
it in the face of all reason; and only a
man of exceptional patience, courage and
ability can keep himself free from the
prejudices and fixed opinions which not
only bring him a delusive peace and
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>certainty but also are the means to worldly
success.</p>

<p>So I would advise the readers of <i>Anticipations</i>
and <i>Mankind in the Making</i> to be
influenced by the spirit rather than by the
letter of these two books. The spirit is
definite enough; it is the spirit of humaneness,
of a passionate criticism of all the evils,
miseries and disease that are the outcome
of our present haphazard civilisation; the
spirit for a desire for order, wider prospects
and opportunities, greater freedom for
growth. Men are born unequal, with different
tendencies, different desires, different
potentialities, but there should be a place
for every one of them in the great economy
of &quot;The New Republic.&quot; Each has to learn
the lesson&mdash;for discipline is essential&mdash;that
he is not an independent unit as regards his
work, but a factor, more or less insignificant,
in the sum of individuals that make up the
greater State. The good New Republican<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>
&quot;will seek perpetually to gauge his quality,
he will watch to see himself the master of
his habits and of his powers; he will take his
brain, blood, body and lineage as a trust to
be administered for the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Such, I think, is the spirit, the permanent
principle of these two books. That remains
and increases. The conception of the process
by which the New Republic shall be
built is less constant, and Mr Wells will
change his opinions concerning it for just
so long as he continues to grow. Should he
ever adopt an inalterable policy, subscribe
to some &quot;ism,&quot; and wear a label, he would
brand himself truly as inconsistent. Then,
indeed, he would have contradicted himself.
We search for truth never hoping to find it
complete and whole; and he who is contented
with a part denies God....</p>

<p><i>A Modern Utopia</i> (1905) is an attempt
to picture &quot;The New Republic&quot; in being; a
very different dream of reconstruction from
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>that displayed in Edward Bellamy's <i>Looking
Backward</i>, and <i>Equality</i>, but having nevertheless
certain points of likeness to the former
at least, and especially in the method of
marking contrasts by a form of parallelism,
by keeping the world as we know it within
the circle of attention in order to break the
paralysing illusion that we are moving in
romantic and quite impossible surroundings.
Mr Wells' machinery is slightly complicated.
He takes two figures from the beginning of
this twentieth century. The Owner of the
Voice (&quot;you will go with him through
curious and interesting experience. Yet,
ever and again, you will find him back at the
table, the manuscript in his hand ...&quot;)
and the &quot;botanist,&quot; a foil and a stimulator
to the other expositor. &quot;The image of a
cinematograph entertainment is the one to
grasp,&quot; writes Mr Wells in his preliminary
explanation. &quot;There will be an effect of
these two people going to and fro in
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>front of the circle of a rather defective
lantern, which sometimes jams and sometimes
gets out of focus, but which does
occasionally succeed in displaying on a
screen a momentary moving picture of
Utopian conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>I think Mr Wells tried very valiantly to
avoid the all too obvious mistake made by
other Utopian builders, both romantic and
practical. He began, I feel sure, with the
admirable intention of depicting the people
of the early twentieth century in new conditions,
changed only in so far as they were
influenced by the presentation of finer ideals
and by more beautiful circumstance. He
even introduced a contemporary critic of
Utopian conditions in the shape of the
talkative person, &quot;a conscious Ishmaelite
in the world of wit, and in some subtly
inexplicable way a most consummate ass.&quot;
But once we begin to postulate our Utopian
villains, the reader's thought is distracted
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>from the contemplation of the heroic which
is the cement that binds every stone in the
visionary city. In order to change conditions
it is necessary to change much in the
present cast of human nature. In a fiction
of Utopia there is no place for a Napoleon,
a Rockefeller, or an ambition-swelled Imperialist.
So Mr Wells is driven with various
hesitations and resentments to assume that
the interactions of cause and effect have
indeed tended to produce a sweeter-tempered,
more generous race of men and women;
that the spirit which moves us now to seek a
larger liberty and a greater tolerance has
been encouraged and increased by the
exercise of its own tendencies and the sight
of its own triumphs; and that those who
set their minds to the building gain an added
grace in the labour. It is a perfectly fair
and consistent assumption, but Mr Wells
has been warned by his predecessors, from
Robert Owen back to Plato and forward to<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>
Edward Bellamy, that the designs for
Utopia have always been flawed by an
altered conception of the humanity that
walks within the city; and he has begun
by trying to avoid a fallacy and ended by
begging a question that he might very well
have convincingly argued.</p>

<p>By many people <i>A Modern Utopia</i> is
definitely labelled as the &quot;Samurai&quot; book.
That conception of a natural aristocracy of
spirit and ability did indeed return upon
its creator in the form of an object lesson
that filled him with a disgust for what was
really a fine ideal, only too temptingly displayed.
So many of his readers, and particularly
his younger readers, formed the
wish to become &quot;Samurai&quot; without more
ado, a high office for which none of them,
perhaps, had the ability or the determination
to fill. For Utopias take even longer to
build than Rome or London. But the plan
is there&mdash;vague and tentative as the original
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>scheme of a Gothic cathedral, a plan to be
continually modified and changed in its most
important features; and the building has
begun....</p>

<p>The last books that can strictly fall into
the present category are <i>The Future of
America</i> (1906) and <i>New Worlds for Old</i>
(1908). The former is rather a record of
impressions than the attempt at prophecy
which the title and the first chapter indicate;
and the final conclusion is too hesitating
even to convince us that America has a
future. &quot;I came to America questioning the
certitudes of progress,&quot; Mr Wells says in his
Envoy. &quot;For a time I forgot my questionings,
I sincerely believed, 'These people
can do anything,' and, now I have it all in
perspective, I have to confess that doubt
has taken me again.&quot; And without question
he has changed his opinion with regard
to many of the observations he made nine
years ago. I sincerely hope he has.</p>

<p><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><i>New Worlds for Old</i> is quite definitely a
book of suggestions with regard to certain
aspects of socialism. It is the most practical
of all the sociological books, and makes
so strong an appeal to the buried common-sense
of even prejudiced readers, that a
devoted Primrose Leaguer to whom I lent
my copy was quite seriously disturbed in
mind for nearly a week after he had read it.
Fortunately for his own peace, he found
an answer that permitted him comfortably
to avoid the perpetual burden of
an active responsibility. He thought that
&quot;Socialism would be all right in a perfect
world,&quot; or words to that effect; and it was
quite evident to him that the effort to make
some small contribution towards raising the
standard of human idealism was no part of
his duty. In any case he greatly preferred
the solid assurance of the Primrose League.
And, speaking generally, as I have tried to
do throughout, I find that <i>New Worlds for
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>Old</i> presents a clearer indication to the possible
path for the idealist than any of the
other sociological essays. <i>Mankind in the
Making</i> dealt very largely with education
directed to a particular end, but in the book
I am now considering may be found certain
outlets for the expression of the less consistently
strenuous. Education, whether of
individual children in the home or regarded
as a function of the State, offers continual
perplexities that only the most resolute can
confront day by day with renewed zeal;
the problems of collective ownership are less
confused by psychology, and the broad principles
may be adopted and the energy of the
young believer directed towards the accomplishment
of minor detail. He may, for example,
find good reason for the nationalising
of the milk supply without committing himself
to any broader theory of expropriation.</p>

<p>Finally I come to the collection of various
papers issued in 1914 under the title <i>An
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>Englishman Looks at the World</i>&mdash;a book that
I may pass with the comment that it exhibits
Mr Wells in his more captious moods,
deliberately more captious in some instances,
no doubt, inasmuch as the various papers
were written for serial publication&mdash;and that
<i>Confession of Faith and Rule of Life</i>, published
in 1907 as <i>First and Last Things</i>.
The opening is unnecessarily complicated
by the exposition of a metaphysic that is
quite uncharacteristic and has little to do
with the personal exposition that follows;
and, indeed, I feel with regard to the whole
work that it attempts to define the indefinable.
I deprecate the note of finality
implied in the title. &quot;It is as it stands
now,&quot; I read in the Introduction, &quot;the
frank confession of what one man of the
early Twentieth Century has found in life
and himself,&quot; but that man has found much
since then, and will continue to find much
as he grows continually richer in experience.<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>
So that while no student of Wells' writings
can afford to overlook <i>First and Last
Things</i>, I would warn him against the
danger of concluding that in that book he
will find at last the ultimate expression of
character and belief, set out in the form of
a categorical creed. Again I find a spirit
and overlook the letter. I choose to take
as representative such a passage as the
following, with all its splendid vagueness
and lack of dogma, rather than a definite
expression of belief that Mr Wells does not
believe in a personal immortality. This
passage runs: &quot;It seems to me that the
whole living creation may be regarded as
walking in its sleep, as walking in the sleep
of individualised illusion, and that now out
of it all rises man, beginning to perceive his
larger self, his universal brotherhood, and
a collective synthetic purpose to increase
Power and realise Beauty....&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>And now that I have attempted my interpretation,
I look back and confess that
it is a very personal reading of my subject.
I may have sought too eagerly for all those
passages in which I found a note that roused
in me the most thrilling response. I may
have omitted to display vital issues that
more truly characterise H.G. Wells than the
appealing urgencies, idealisms, and fluencies
that I have found most sympathetic and
most admirable. But if I appear to have
done him an injustice in some particulars,
it is rather because I have been absorbed
by the issue I sought to reveal, than because
I deliberately weighed and rejected others.
This short essay can be no more than an
introduction to the works it describes. It
was never intended to be critical. I have
had no intention of discussing technique,
nor of weighing Mr Wells against his contemporaries
in any literary scale. But I
have attempted to interpret the spirit and
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>the message that I have found in his books;
and I have made the essay in the hope that
any reader who may consequently be stirred
to read or to re-read Wells will do so with
a mind prepared to look below the surface
expression.</p>

<p>I feel no shade of hesitation when I say
that H.G. Wells is a great writer. His
fecundity, his mastery of language, his comprehension
of character are gifts and abilities
that certain of his contemporaries have in
equal, or in some particulars in larger
measure. But he alone has used his
perfected art for a definite end. He has not
been content to record his observations of
the world as he has seen it, to elaborate this
or that analysis of human motive, or to
relate the history of a few selected lives. He
has done all this, but he has done infinitely
more by pointing the possible road of our
endeavour. Through all his work moves
the urgency of one who would create some<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>thing
more than a mere work of art to amuse
the multitude or afford satisfaction to the
critic. His chief achievement is that he has
set up the ideal of a finer civilisation, of a
more generous life than that in which we live;
an ideal that, if it is still too high for us of
this generation, will be appreciated and
followed by the people of the future.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
